# persister

Quickly prototype your software without having the database slow you down. Simple Persistence for Clojure. Based on/inspired by <https://github.com/SergeyDidenko/Simple-Persistence-for-Clojure/>.

Writing to the FS is useful for development, but for use on platforms like Heroku, the FS isn't available.
